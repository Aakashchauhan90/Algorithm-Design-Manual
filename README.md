Implementations of data structures and algorithms inspired by Steven S. Skiena's *The Algorithm Design Manual*, The Second Edition.

Currently implemented algorithms:
* Breadth-First Search
* Prim's Algorithm for finding the minimum-spanning tree
* Kruskal's Algorithm for finding the minimum-spanning-tree
* Floyd's Algorithm for finding all shortest path pairs in a graph
* Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path
* A generic network flow algorithm for calculating the maximum flow possible in a network
* A bipartite matching algorithm which uses a network flow algorithm to find the largest possible matching in a graph
* Backtracking for subsets and permutations
